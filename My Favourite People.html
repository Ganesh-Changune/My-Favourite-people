            <h1 style="color: Gold;">Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj </h1>

            <p style="font-size: 22px; color: white;">Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj (1630–1680) was a legendary Indian ruler and the 		      	founder of the Maratha Empire in western India. Born at Shivneri Fort to Shahaji Bhonsle and Jijabai, Shivaji 		       	was deeply influenced by his mother’s teachings, which instilled in him a strong sense of justice and 				responsibility towards his people. From a young age, he demonstrated exceptional leadership and military 			acumen. At just 16, he captured his first fort, Torna, marking the beginning of his campaign to establish an 			independent Maratha kingdom.

			Shivaji Maharaj's rise was marked by his innovative use of guerrilla warfare, strategic fortifications, and 			the creation of a disciplined, multi-caste army. He was also a pioneer in building a strong navy to secure 			the Konkan coast, earning him the title “Father of the Indian Navy”. His administrative reforms were 				progressive for their time; he divided his kingdom into provinces (prants or subhas) and established a 				council of eight ministers (Ashtapradhan) to oversee governance, defense, and justice.

			Shivaji’s reign was characterized by constant conflict with the Mughal Empire and other regional powers, but 			his strategic brilliance allowed him to expand and consolidate his realm. He died on April 3, 1680, at 				Raigad, but his vision of “Hindavi Swarajya” (self-rule of the people) and his legacy as a just, courageous, 			and visionary leader continue to inspire generations.</p>

She is not just a parent, but a constant source of love, strength, and inspiration. Her 					presence brings warmth and comfort to our home, and her selfless nature is something I admire 					every day.

				From the moment I wake up to the time I go to bed, my mom is always thinking about our family’s needs 				before her own. Whether it’s preparing delicious meals, managing household chores, or helping me with 				my problems, she does everything with love and patience. Her smile, even after a long and tiring day, 				shows how strong and caring she truly is.

				She has taught me the values of honesty, kindness, and hard work. Whenever I face difficulties, she 				encourages me to stay positive and not give up. Her faith in me gives me confidence to move forward 				in life.

				What makes her special is not just what she does, but how she does it—with grace, dedication, and a 				heart full of love. She finds happiness in our smallest achievements and stands like a rock during 				our failures.To me, she is not just a mother but a best friend, guide, and the soul of our family.
	
				I feel truly blessed to have her in my life, and I hope to make her proud by following her 					footsteps. My mom is, and always will be, my greatest inspiration.
